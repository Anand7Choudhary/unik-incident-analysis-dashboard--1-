The chat timeout/cooldown logic is located entirely within one file:
File: components/ChatAssistant.tsx
I'll show you the specific lines of code you need to look at and how you can modify them.
Where to Find the Code
Inside components/ChatAssistant.tsx, there are two key places that control the 60-second cooldown:
The State Initialization (Line ~29): This line sets the default duration of the cooldown.
code
TypeScript
const [cooldown, setCooldown] = useState({ active: false, seconds: 60 });
The Send Message Handler (Line ~80): This line is what actually starts the cooldown timer when you send a message.
code
TypeScript
const handleSendMessage = async (e: React.FormEvent, messageText: string = input) => {
    // ... other code ...
    setIsLoading(true);
    setCooldown({ active: true, seconds: 60 }); // <-- THIS LINE TRIGGERS IT
    // ... other code ...
};
How to Manually Change It
Here are the simple steps to either decrease the time or disable it completely.
To Decrease the Cooldown Time (e.g., to 30 seconds):
Go to components/ChatAssistant.tsx.
Change the 60 to 30 in both of the locations mentioned above.
Change this (line ~29):
code
TypeScript
// From:
const [cooldown, setCooldown] = useState({ active: false, seconds: 60 });
// To:
const [cooldown, setCooldown] = useState({ active: false, seconds: 30 });
And change this (line ~80):
code
TypeScript
// From:
setCooldown({ active: true, seconds: 60 });
// To:
setCooldown({ active: true, seconds: 30 });
To Completely Disable the Cooldown:
Go to components/ChatAssistant.tsx.
Find the handleSendMessage function.
Simply comment out or delete the line that sets the cooldown.
code
TypeScript
const handleSendMessage = async (e: React.FormEvent, messageText: string = input) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!messageText.trim() || isLoading) return; // Note: removed cooldown.active from here

    const userMessage: Message = { role: 'user', content: messageText, id: `user-${Date.now()}` };
    const updatedMessages = [...messages, userMessage];
    setMessages(updatedMessages);
    setInput('');
    setIsLoading(true);
    
    // V V V COMMENT OUT THIS LINE V V V
    // setCooldown({ active: true, seconds: 60 }); 
    // ^ ^ ^ COMMENT OUT THIS LINE ^ ^ ^

    // ... the rest of the function remains the same ...
};
You will also want to remove the cooldown.active check from the if condition at the top of the function so the send button works correctly.
